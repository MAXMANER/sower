### Step 1: Install the package and its dependencies

```bash
pip install sower_client-1.0.tar.gz
```

This step installs sower_client with its dependencies. The `pip install` command installs the package from the specified `.tar.gz` file, which was created in the previous step during the package build process.

### Step 2: Copy the service file to Systemd directory

```bash
sudo cp sower_client.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

This step copies the `sower_client.service` file to the Systemd directory. The Systemd directory (`/etc/systemd/system/`) is where Systemd service unit files are typically stored. By copying the service file to this directory, you make it available for Systemd to manage.

### Step 3: Enable and start the service

```bash
sudo systemctl enable sower_client
sudo systemctl start sower_client
```

These commands enable and start the background service using Systemd. The `systemctl enable` command enables the service, which means it will start automatically at system boot. The `systemctl start` command starts the service immediately. Replace `sower_client` with the actual name of your service.

### Step 4: Verify the service status

```bash
sudo systemctl status sower_client
```

This command displays the status of the service. It provides information about whether the service is running, any recent logs, and other relevant details. Replace `sower_client` with the actual name of your service.

By following these steps, you install your Python package, copy the service file to the appropriate directory, enable and start the service using Systemd, and then verify its status.
